# Scoring

## Category Weights

Use these default weights for Android Jetpack Compose app repositories:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Performance | 35% |
| State management | 25% |
| Side effects | 20% |
| Composable API quality | 20% |

Performance carries the heaviest weight in v1 because Compose performance issues are the most common reason teams audit a codebase, and the smells are the most measurable from source alone. For state-heavy apps with little perf-sensitive UI (forms, dashboards, settings), a 30/30/20/20 split is reasonable — apply judgment and document the choice in the report's "Notes And Limits" section.

### N/A vs Low Confidence

Mark a category `N/A` only when its surface area is structurally absent — for example, scoring API quality on a repo with zero shared/reusable components. If the surface area is merely thin, score it with `Low` confidence instead of dropping it. `N/A` should be rare.

### Renormalization

If a category is `N/A`, renormalize the remaining weights so they still sum to 1.0:

`weight_i_new = weight_i / sum(remaining_weights)`

Worked example — Composable API quality is `N/A`, so the remaining weights are Performance (35%), State (25%), Side effects (20%), summing to 80%:

- Performance: `0.35 / 0.80 = 0.4375` → 44%
- State: `0.25 / 0.80 = 0.3125` → 31%
- Side effects: `0.20 / 0.80 = 0.2500` → 25%

State the renormalization in the report.

## Score Bands

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0-3 | fail | Systemic issues, repeated misuse, or architecture-level risk |
| 4-6 | needs work | Mixed quality, recurring smells, meaningful refactor value |
| 7-8 | solid | Mostly healthy with some targeted fixes needed |
| 9-10 | excellent | Consistently strong patterns, only minor issues |

## Overall Score

Report both:

- per-category scores on a `0-10` scale
- an overall score on a `0-100` scale

Compute:

`overall = weighted_average(category_scores) * 10`

Round to the nearest whole number.

## Confidence

Add a confidence note in the report:

- `High`: enough Compose surface area, multiple representative modules/files read
- `Medium`: some categories based on limited sample size
- `Low`: small repo, partial module access, or sparse Compose surface

Low confidence does not block scoring, but it must be stated clearly.

## Category Rubric

Each rule below carries an inline citation. **Every deduction in the report must reference the same citation** so readers can verify against the official source.

### Performance

Reward:

- expensive calculations cached with `remember(keys)` or moved out of composition → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- stable `key =` in lazy layouts where list identity matters → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- `contentType` on heterogeneous lazy lists, so Compose can reuse compositions only between items of the same type → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- `derivedStateOf` used for state that changes faster than its observable output (e.g. scroll position → "show button" boolean) → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- deferred reads via lambda modifiers (`Modifier.offset { … }`, `Modifier.graphicsLayer { … }`, `Modifier.drawBehind { … }`) → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices), [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases)
- absence of backwards writes (writing to state that has already been read in the same composition) → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- absence of cross-phase back-writes — measured size/position from a layout callback consumed in layout/draw (`Modifier.layout { }` / `Modifier.drawBehind { }`) rather than round-tripped through composition-read state → [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases)
- stability hygiene: `@Stable` / `@Immutable` on data classes used as composable params → [docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability)
- `kotlinx.collections.immutable` (`ImmutableList`, `PersistentList`) for collection params — earns a skip when Strong Skipping is off, and under Strong Skipping still pays off via stable `equals()` / `hashCode()` (making the instance-equality check cheap and correct) and structural sharing (no per-recomposition `List.copy()`). Reward independently of the compiler track → [stability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability), [fix](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix)
- `compose_compiler_config.conf` used to mark third-party types stable → [fix](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix)
- typed state factories (`mutableIntStateOf`, `mutableLongStateOf`, `mutableFloatStateOf`, `mutableDoubleStateOf`) for primitives instead of boxed `mutableStateOf<Int>` → [state](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state)
- `@ReadOnlyComposable` / `@NonRestartableComposable` used deliberately on hot-path helpers → [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping)
- evidence of Strong Skipping Mode awareness (Kotlin 2.0.20+ / Compose Compiler 1.5.4+); opt-outs (`@NonSkippableComposable`, `@DontMemoize`) used only with justification → [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping)
- evidence of performance-aware configuration such as baseline profiles, R8 / minify enabled in release, or `ProfileInstaller` setup → [baseline profiles](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/baseline-profiles)
- `ReportDrawnWhen { ... }` used to signal first-meaningful-content for accurate TTID/TTFD metrics → [tooling](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/tooling)
- edge-to-edge opt-in via `enableEdgeToEdge()` (first-party) rather than `accompanist-systemuicontroller` on projects that support it → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- evidence the team uses Compose Compiler reports / metrics to verify skippability → [tooling](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/tooling), [diagnose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/diagnose)
- animated values read through lambda modifiers (`Modifier.graphicsLayer { ... }`, `Modifier.offset { ... }`, `Modifier.drawBehind { ... }`) so per-frame updates stay in the layout/draw phase and skip recomposition → [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases), [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based)
- `Animatable` held in `remember { Animatable(...) }` and driven from a `LaunchedEffect` — state survives recomposition, animation is cancelled on dispose → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based)
- `AnimatedContent` used when the call site needs custom enter/exit or size-aware content transforms, while `Crossfade` is used for standard fade-only content swaps → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/introduction)
- multiple properties that animate off the same state change share one `updateTransition` instead of independent `animate*AsState` calls that can drift out of sync → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based#updatetransition)

Deduct for:

- non-trivial work in composable bodies — collection transforms (`filter` / `sortedBy` / `groupBy` / `sumOf`), O(N) string ops (`split`, `lines`, `lineSequence`, `replace`, `format`), `Regex(...)` constructed or executed inline, hashing or non-trivial constructors. **`remember` is not a sufficient fix**: the cached body still runs on the composition thread on first composition and on every key change, which is a frame hitch on screen entry. The correct fix is moving the work to a presenter / state holder / ViewModel. O(1) is not a free pass — object initialisation, lock acquisition, and side-effectful constructors can be expensive even when nominally constant-time → [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices), [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases)
- lazy list items without stable keys when identity/moves matter → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- heterogeneous lazy lists missing `contentType` → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- reading rapidly changing state too high in the tree → [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases), [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- frequent-state values passed to non-lambda modifiers when a layout/draw-phase alternative exists → [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- backwards writes — writing to state already read in the same composition body → [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- cross-phase back-writes (axis 3) — a **layout-phase** callback (`onSizeChanged` / `onGloballyPositioned` / `onPlaced`) writing state that a sibling **reads in composition** (measure → write → recompose loop). Deduct when a composition-phase read of the written state exists; promote to a Critical Finding when the loop is per-frame or spans reused lazy items → [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases), [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- composition-phase self-invalidation — a `SnapshotStateMap` / `SnapshotStateList` mutated (`putAll` / `put` / `add` / `addAll` / `remove` / `clear` / `[k] =` / `+=` / `-=`) inside a `@Composable` body that also reads it. This overlaps the same-body backwards-write rule above — **score it once** (prefer the backwards-write rule for read→write; use this for the mutate-then-read / self-feeding shape). Not a cross-phase issue: the write and read are both in composition → [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- repeated broad recomposition smells across screens/components → [stability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability)
- raw `List`/`Map`/`Set` parameters on widely reused composables when the rest of the codebase has the immutable-collections dependency available — deduct when Strong Skipping is OFF (unstable params block skipping outright), or when Strong Skipping is ON but the collection is rebuilt per recomposition in source (e.g. `listOf(a, b)` / `mapOf(...)` in a composable body, a getter that allocates, or `.toList()` / `.filter { }` on every call). Under Strong Skipping without observable churn, do not deduct → [stability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability)
- unstable composable params whose `equals()` is expensive, allocating, or semantically broken — for example, a plain `class Foo(...)` with identity equality passed to a reusable composable, a `data class` wrapping a large collection (deep `equals` on every recomposition), or a `data class` with mutable fields (stale skip results). Under Strong Skipping, every recomposition runs `equals()` on each unstable param to decide whether to skip; expensive equality can make "skipping" as costly as recomposing, and broken equality makes skipping silently wrong → [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping), [stability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability)
- instance-recreation churn in source: `listOf(...)` / `mapOf(...)` / `setOf(...)` / anonymous `object` literals / `MyParams(...)` allocated inside a hot composable body and passed as a param. The value is `!=` to the prior recomposition's value by default, so both vanilla skipping and Strong Skipping's `==` gate fail, forcing the callee to re-run body-and-children. Hoist into `remember(...)`, a state holder, or a `@Composable` caller further up. **Bare lambda literals are exempt under Strong Skipping** — the compiler auto-memoizes lambdas passed to composables, so do not treat a plain `onClick = { ... }` as churn or recommend wrapping it in `remember` (that is a false lead — see the guard below); SSM memoizes lambdas *even with unstable captures*, so a lambda churns only SSM-**off** or on a `@DontMemoize` path → [stability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability), [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping)
- `mutableStateOf<Int|Long|Float|Double>` where the typed factory exists (autoboxing) → [state](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state)
- `derivedStateOf { ... }` whose block does not actually read any `State` object (meaning it will never invalidate, and the overhead of `derivedStateOf` is wasted) → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` opt-outs without a justifying comment → [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping)
- if the project is on a Compose Compiler track older than 1.5.4 / Kotlin 2.0.20, stability matters more than the rules above assume — note this in the report and weight unstable-param findings more heavily → [strong skipping](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/strongskipping)
- `remember { … }` whose body reads `LocalConfiguration`, `LocalDensity`, or `LocalLayoutDirection` without declaring those values as keys — the cached value silently goes stale on rotation / foldable posture / font-scale changes → [state](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state)
- `indexOf()` / `lastIndexOf()` / `indexOfFirst { }` called inside a `LazyListScope` item factory — O(n²) scroll cost and crash risk when identity moves; use `itemsIndexed` instead → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- `animateItemPlacement()` on Compose 1.7+ — replaced by `Modifier.animateItem()` → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- Accompanist libraries where first-party replacements exist: `accompanist-pager` (→ `HorizontalPager`), `accompanist-swiperefresh` (→ `PullToRefreshBox`), `accompanist-flowlayout` (→ `FlowRow` / `FlowColumn`), `accompanist-systemuicontroller` (→ `enableEdgeToEdge()`) — deduct only when the replacement is available on the project's Compose version → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- `Canvas` / `Spacer` with only `Modifier.fillMaxSize()` and no explicit height or aspect ratio — may enter draw with `Size.Zero`, producing `NaN` math and Skia-pipeline crashes. Require `Modifier.size(...)`, `Modifier.height(...)`, or `Modifier.aspectRatio(...)` on drawing surfaces → [bestpractices](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/bestpractices)
- lazy-list `key = { ... }` computed from a source that cannot guarantee uniqueness (merged flows, paginated streams, `hashCode()` on non-`data class`) — `IllegalArgumentException: Key ... was already used` crashes production. Verify with the duplicate-lazy-key heuristic in `search-playbook.md` → [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- `Animatable(...)` created inside a composable body without `remember { Animatable(...) }` (and not hoisted from a state holder) — the animation state is rebuilt on recomposition, which restarts the animation and drops in-flight velocity/target → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based)
- per-frame animated values read in the composition body and piped into non-lambda modifiers (`Modifier.offset(x.value.dp)`, `Modifier.alpha(alpha.value)`, `Modifier.rotate(rot.value)`). Every frame triggers recomposition of the caller instead of only re-laying-out or re-drawing. Prefer lambda-form `Modifier.offset { IntOffset(x.value.roundToInt(), 0) }` / `Modifier.graphicsLayer { alpha = alphaAnim.value; rotationZ = rot.value }` → [phases](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/phases), [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based)
- `rememberInfiniteTransition()` hosted in a composable that stays in composition while offscreen (e.g. inside a `Scaffold` content that does not unmount on tab switch) — the animation keeps running until the host is removed from composition, creating needless offscreen work. Host it inside `AnimatedVisibility` / lazy-list item, or gate with an `if (visible) { ... }` branch → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based)
- several `animate*AsState` calls in the same composable all keyed off the same boolean/enum when `updateTransition` would keep them synchronized — light deduction when the drift is user-visible (alpha/scale/color finishing at different times) → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based#updatetransition)

When any of these animation rules affects the Performance score, name it in the Performance section as **Animation phase correctness** rather than folding it into a generic recomposition note. Readers should be able to see at a glance whether animation contributed to the score.

- `LazyPagingItems` rendered with `items(count = …)` but **missing `key =`** or using **index-only keys** on a paginated/merged feed — reorder, refresh, and prepend can crash or thrash compositions → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose), [lists](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lists)
- treating `LazyPagingItems` like a materialized list (`itemSnapshotList` primary UI path, `forEach` into a nested lazy list) instead of the supported `items(count = …)` integration → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)

When any of these paging rules affects the Performance score, name it in the Performance section as **Paging list correctness** rather than folding it into a generic lazy-list note.

Suggested interpretation:

- `9-10`: clean patterns are common and performance smells are rare
- `7-8`: minor or localized issues
- `4-6`: repeated recomposition or lazy-list issues
- `0-3`: serious, widespread performance problems or unsafe state-write patterns

#### Measured Ceilings (apply when compiler reports are available)

Compiler reports generated in Step 4 give hard numbers. When present, apply these ceilings *after* qualitative scoring — a category cannot exceed the cap even if qualitative evidence is strong. Report the applied ceiling in the Performance section so the score is auditable.

Let `skippable%` = `skippableComposables / restartableComposables` from `*-module.json`.
However, because zero-argument lambdas structurally cannot skip and artificially anchor this overall metric, you MUST also compute the **named-only `skippable%`** from `*-composables.csv` (by filtering out rows where `isLambda == "1"`). Use this **named-only percentage** for the ceiling conditions below, and state the distinction clearly in the report.

**Before applying a table, determine whether Strong Skipping is active** (Kotlin **2.0.20+** / Compose Compiler **1.5.4+** is the default; earlier versions can opt in via `-Pandroidx.compose.compiler.enableStrongSkippingMode=true` or the equivalent `freeCompilerArgs` flag). This choice changes which table applies, because Strong Skipping fundamentally changes what `skippable%` and the unstable-classes count are worth.

##### When Strong Skipping is OFF (pre-2.0.20 or explicitly disabled)

Unstable params genuinely block skipping, so both `skippable%` and the unstable-classes count are meaningful signals.

| Condition | Ceiling |
|-----------|---------|
| `skippable%` ≥ 95% AND zero unstable classes used as shared/reusable composable params | no cap (9-10 possible) |
| `skippable%` ≥ 85% AND ≤3 unstable classes used as shared/reusable composable params | cap at 8 |
| `skippable%` 70-85% OR 4-7 unstable classes used as params | cap at 6 |
| `skippable%` 50-70% OR ≥8 unstable classes used as params | cap at 4 |
| `skippable%` < 50% | cap at 3 |
| Strong Skipping disabled on a Kotlin 2.0.20+ project without written justification | cap at 4 |
| `@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` used on hot-path composables without justification | cap at 5 |

##### When Strong Skipping is ON (Kotlin 2.0.20+ default)

Under Strong Skipping, all restartable composables become skippable and lambdas are auto-memoized; skipping is decided per-recomposition via `==` on unstable params. `skippable%` therefore trends toward ~100% almost by construction and loses most of its discriminating power — so the ceiling leans more heavily on qualitative evidence. The unstable-classes *count* also stops mattering on its own; what matters is whether those unstable params are (a) re-allocated per recomposition, or (b) backed by expensive or broken `equals()`.

| Condition | Ceiling |
|-----------|---------|
| Named-only `skippable%` ≥ 95% AND no observed instance-recreation churn AND no expensive / broken `equals()` on unstable params AND no unjustified `@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` | no cap (9-10 possible) |
| Named-only `skippable%` ≥ 95% BUT a handful of unstable params are recreated per recomposition OR carry non-trivial `equals()` cost | cap at 8 |
| Widespread instance-recreation churn in source (e.g. `listOf(...)` / `mapOf(...)` / anonymous literals in hot composable bodies), OR expensive / broken `equals()` on unstable params passed through widely reused composables | cap at 6 |
| Named-only `skippable%` < 90% despite Strong Skipping being on (typically: `@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` spread across hot paths, inline/value-class edge cases, or compiler-rejected composable shapes) | cap at 4 |
| `@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` used on hot-path composables without justification | cap at 5 |

Under Strong Skipping the more informative evidence is no longer "how many unstable classes are there" but:

- **Instance-recreation churn in source** — `listOf(a, b)`, `mapOf(...)`, anonymous `object` literals, or `MyParams(a, b)` allocated inside a composable body and passed as a param. The SSM `==` check fails on every recomposition and the callee re-runs regardless of skippability. (Plain **lambda** literals are auto-memoized by SSM *even with unstable captures* — exclude them here; a lambda only churns SSM-off or on a `@DontMemoize` path.)
- **`equals()` cost and correctness on unstable params** — SSM calls `equals()` on each unstable param every recomposition. Expensive equality (`data class` wrapping a large collection, custom `equals` that walks a graph) can make skipping as costly as recomposing; broken equality (identity equality on a plain `class`, mutable fields inside a `data class`) makes skipping silently wrong.
- **Runtime recomposition counts** (Layout Inspector, `Recomposer` debug output, Compose UI tests with `Modifier.testTag` + recomposition counters). When available these beat `skippable%` as the primary signal under SSM.
- **`@NonSkippableComposable` / `@DontMemoize` opt-outs** — effectively the only way to see a "not skippable" named composable under SSM; each instance should carry a justifying comment and appear on hot paths only with cause.

When compiler reports are **not** available (Step 4 failed, `Compiler diagnostics used: no`), ceilings do not apply — rely on source-inferred judgment, but cap any Performance score at 7 to reflect reduced confidence.

If a non-trivial subset of modules failed to build (partial reports), state which modules contributed and treat `skippable%` as a floor estimate rather than a ground truth.

#### Do Not Credit — False Leads

Changes that *look* like recomposition fixes but do not reduce recomposition count. **Never reward them, and never emit them in `Prioritized Fixes`.** If the codebase already applies one, treat it as neutral (no credit); if a finding's suggested fix would be one of these, discard the finding or replace the fix with the real one. When code applies a false lead *in place of* the real fix, the underlying smell still stands and is scored on its own merits.

| Looks like a fix | Why it does nothing | Real lever |
|---|---|---|
| `remember(index) { isFirstRow(index) }` (or any `remember(k)` wrapping a pure, cheap function of its own key) | Same inputs each call; the memo saves no work and adds bookkeeping — no skipping benefit | Inline the expression; only `remember` genuinely expensive work keyed on real inputs |
| Identity/instance cache for a read-only derived map (`remember { }` returning a cached map to preserve reference equality) | Can serve stale overlays; `remember(keys)` on the actual inputs is enough and correct | `remember(keys) { derive() }` — key on the inputs, not on identity |
| `mutableIntStateOf` + a layout modifier applied to **both** the measured row and its sibling | The sibling still reads the size **in composition** unless it is measure-only; boxing was never the problem | Make the sibling read measured size in layout/draw (`Modifier.layout { }`), or hoist the shared value out of the round-trip |
| Forcing `assertRecompositionCount(Exactly(1))` on **both** rows in a focus-move / selection test | One row often *correctly* recomposes 0 times; the assertion encodes a wrong expectation, not a fix | Assert the count each row should actually have; investigate only rows that exceed it |
| Manually `remember`-ing callbacks **under Strong Skipping** (Kotlin 2.0.20+ default) to "stabilize" them | SSM auto-memoizes lambdas already — *including those with unstable captures*; wrapping them in `remember` adds bookkeeping for no skipping benefit | Nothing — SSM has it covered. Only matters SSM-**off** or on a `@DontMemoize` path: then hoist **and** stabilize, or pass a method reference |

**Strong Skipping caveat for the last row:** the "fresh lambda defeats skipping" reasoning only holds when SSM is **off**, or the lambda sits on a `@DontMemoize` opt-out path. (`@NonSkippableComposable` opts the *composable* out of skipping but does **not** disable lambda memoization — do not list it here.) On the default SSM track, manual `remember` on the callback is itself the no-op — SSM memoizes lambdas *even with unstable captures*, so do not recommend it, and do not deduct for its absence. Decide which compiler track applies (see the Strong Skipping Mode Check) before scoring this one.

Route: the cross-phase and stability *detectors* live in the search playbook; this false-lead guard lives here in scoring and gates what those detectors are allowed to recommend. Before crediting any "we optimized recomposition here" claim, confirm it is not one of the above — prefer runtime recomposition counts or compiler reports as proof over the presence of the pattern.

- string-based navigation routes (`composable("home")`, `navigate("profile/$id")`) on Navigation Compose 2.8+ where type-safe `@Serializable` routes are available — loses compile-time checking and encourages argument-encoding bugs → [navigation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation)
- `mutableStateOf` held in a `ViewModel` instead of `StateFlow` / `MutableStateFlow` — couples the ViewModel to the Compose runtime and hurts testability. App-level teams may accept this tradeoff deliberately; note the tradeoff rather than deducting heavily unless it is widespread → [architecture](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture)
- ViewModel-to-UI events modeled only as `Channel` / `SharedFlow` when the outcome must survive lifecycle gaps (snackbars, validation messages, navigation decisions). Prefer durable UI state with an acknowledgement callback for must-deliver outcomes; reserve `Channel` / `SharedFlow` for ephemeral signals with documented delivery semantics → [UI events](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/events), [architecture](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture)
- `rememberSaveable` used inside a `LazyListScope` item factory (per-item expansion state, per-item form fields) — each entry is serialized into the saved-state `Bundle` which is capped at ~1 MB; large lists trigger `TransactionTooLargeException` → [state](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state)
- paging UI that ignores `LazyPagingItems.loadState` — blank screen during initial refresh, stuck spinner, or silent failure with no `retry()` path → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)
- duplicate manual loading flags (`mutableStateOf(isLoading)`) shadowing `loadState` on paging screens — two sources of truth for the same UX → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)
- `loadState.append is LoadState.Error` handled only as a spinner or not at all — append failures leave the user with no way to resume the feed; an append-error footer must offer `retry()` → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)
- `lazyPagingItems[index]!!` (or assuming every slot is non-null) — with `PagingConfig.enablePlaceholders = true`, slots are `null` while a page loads and `!!` NPE-crashes; the dual smell is a placeholder branch that can never run because placeholders are disabled → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)
- `loadState.refresh is LoadState.Error -> FullScreenError()` with **no `itemCount == 0` guard** — a transient pull-to-refresh failure then wipes an already-loaded feed and replaces it with a full-screen error. Full-screen error should gate on `itemCount == 0`; refresh errors arriving with content on screen belong in a snackbar / inline retry → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose)

When any of these paging rules affects the State management score, name it in the State section as **Paging load-state handling** rather than folding it into a generic state note.

**Navigation 3 deductions (State management)**

When Nav3 is detected (see playbook section 2b), also deduct for:
- `entryDecorators` list supplied without re-adding `rememberSaveableStateHolderNavEntryDecorator()` — `rememberSaveable` inside entries silently stops persisting state → [Nav3 save state](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3/save-state)
- Anonymous or non-top-level `NavKey` destination types — breaks process-death restore and `rememberSaveable` for that entry → [Nav3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3)
- Feature/screen ViewModel owns or mutates the back stack directly — navigation lifecycle coupled to ViewModel, defeats predictive back and scene strategies → [Nav3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3)
- `ResultEventBus` / `conflateAsState` result treated as surviving process death — result is only available within the current navigation lifetime; persist in `SavedStateHandle` if survival is required → [Nav3 save state](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3/save-state)

Name Nav3 state findings as **Nav3 backstack state** in the State section.

Suggested interpretation:

- `9-10`: strong UDF, clear ownership, minimal ambiguity
- `7-8`: mostly healthy with some hoisting or saveability gaps
- `4-6`: repeated ownership confusion or weak state boundaries
- `0-3`: systemic duplication, stale data risks, or non-observable state misuse

### Side Effects

All citations in this category point to the canonical [Side-effects in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects) page unless noted. The official docs put `derivedStateOf` and `snapshotFlow` under side-effects. v1 keeps `derivedStateOf` weighted under Performance because that's where its value most often lands in audits, but the side-effects category also looks at it for *misuse*. Pick the dominant category and cross-reference rather than double-counting.

Reward:

- side-effect-free composition → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- correct use of `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, `SideEffect`, `rememberUpdatedState`, and `produceState` → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- effects keyed to the right lifecycle inputs → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- cleanup for listeners, observers, and subscriptions → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- stale callback capture avoided with `rememberUpdatedState` when needed → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `snapshotFlow { … }` collected from inside a `LaunchedEffect` for Compose-state → Flow conversions → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `rememberCoroutineScope()` used only for event-driven work (button taps, gesture handlers); long-lived/keyed work lives in `LaunchedEffect` → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- navigation, snackbar, analytics, and repository calls live in event handlers or `LaunchedEffect`, never in the composition body → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects), [navigation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation)
- image loading delegated to threading-aware loaders (Coil, Glide) via their Compose integration APIs (`AsyncImage`, `rememberAsyncImagePainter`) — these manage the threading contract correctly and are the accepted carve-out from "no IO in composition" → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- suspending UI / ViewModel paths preserve structured cancellation: broad catches and `runCatching` rethrow `CancellationException` before converting failures into UI state → [coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-best-practices)
- `Animatable.animateTo(...)` / `snapTo(...)` driven from a `LaunchedEffect(key)` so the animation cancels on key change and on composition exit → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based), [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- declarative targets use `animate*AsState` and leave coroutine management to Compose; manual `rememberCoroutineScope().launch { ... }` is reserved for event-driven or gesture-driven animation → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based), [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)

Deduct for:

- launching threads, coroutines, navigation, or external work directly in composition → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- **strictly forbidden IO in a composable body** — never appears in composition regardless of how it is wrapped (`remember` does not redeem it, since the work still runs on the composition thread on first composition and on every key change). Categories: serialization/deserialization (`Json.decodeFromString`, `Gson`, `Moshi`, `ObjectMapper`, XML/Protobuf/CSV); network access (`HttpClient`, `OkHttp`, `Retrofit`, `URL(...)`, `Socket`); database connections or queries (`DriverManager`, `Connection`, `prepareStatement`, `executeQuery`, raw Room/SQLite calls); file or directory IO (`File(...)`, `Files.*`, `FileInputStream`, `BufferedReader`); subprocess / process IO (`ProcessBuilder`, `Runtime.exec`). Threading-aware image loaders (Coil, Glide) used via their Compose integration APIs are the explicit carve-out → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- wrong effect API choice → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- incorrect or missing effect keys → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- stale captures in long-lived effects → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- empty or suspicious `onDispose` → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- listeners or observers registered without cleanup → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `snapshotFlow { … }` invoked outside an effect, or used to compute values that `derivedStateOf` would handle more cheaply → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `rememberCoroutineScope()` used to launch work that should live in a keyed `LaunchedEffect` (manual cancellation, lifecycle handling reinvented) → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `derivedStateOf { a + b }`-style misuse where inputs change as often as outputs — pure overhead per the official guidance → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` / `LaunchedEffect(true)` flagged only when the body captures parameter or state values that may change without being keyed or wrapped in `rememberUpdatedState`. The "run once on enter" pattern itself is idiomatic; do not deduct for it → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `rememberUpdatedState` read eagerly inside `remember { ... }` and assigned to a captured local before invocation — the remembered object keeps the initial callback/value forever. Read the `State.value` at invocation time or key the remembered object on the source value → [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `runCatching { ... }`, `catch (Exception)`, or `catch (Throwable)` around suspend calls without rethrowing `CancellationException` — cancellation is converted into an error state instead of propagating through the coroutine hierarchy → [coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-best-practices)
- `navController.navigate(...)` invoked from the composition body instead of an event handler or effect → [navigation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation)
- `rememberCoroutineScope().launch { animatable.animateTo(target) }` where a `LaunchedEffect(target) { animatable.animateTo(target) }` would more clearly express target-driven animation — prefer `LaunchedEffect(target)` when restart semantics should follow the key automatically; keep `rememberCoroutineScope()` for event- or gesture-driven animation → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based), [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- `Animatable.animateTo(...)` invoked from the composition body (not from inside an effect) — runs on every recomposition and never cancels → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/value-based), [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)
- unconditional `lazyPagingItems.refresh()` / `retry()` from the composable body or bare `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` without a documented one-shot reason — initial load belongs to `PagingData`; refresh is user-driven → [paging compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-compose), [side-effects](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/side-effects)

When this paging rule affects the Side Effects score, name it in the Side Effects section as **Paging side-effect signals** rather than folding it into a generic effect note — mirroring **Paging list correctness** (Performance) and **Paging load-state handling** (State).

**Navigation 3 deductions (Side Effects)**

When Nav3 is detected (see playbook section 2b), also deduct for:
- `backStack.add` / `backStack.removeLastOrNull` called directly in the composition body instead of inside an event handler or `LaunchedEffect` — navigation fires on every recomposition → [Nav3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3)
- Tap handler missing `dropUnlessResumed { backStack.add(...) }` — a queued tap can navigate from a screen already in exit animation, duplicating the back-stack entry → [Nav3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3)

Note: "feature ViewModel owns/mutates the back stack" is a **State Management** finding (see above), not Side Effects — do not score it here.

Name Nav3 side-effect findings as **Nav3 navigation side effects** in the Side Effects section.

Suggested interpretation:

- `9-10`: deliberate, lifecycle-aware effect usage
- `7-8`: mostly correct with small effect-key or cleanup issues
- `4-6`: recurring misuse of effects or composition-time work
- `0-3`: side effects commonly happen in composition or cleanup is broadly unsafe

### Composable API Quality

This category is lighter-touch for app repositories. Focus on shared internal components, UI kits, and reusable building blocks. The two authoritative sources are the [Compose API guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines) and the deeper [Component API guidelines](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md).

Reward:

- reusable components expose `modifier: Modifier = Modifier` → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- `modifier` is the first optional parameter and applied once as the first link in the chain on the root-most UI node → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- parameter order is sensible: required, `modifier`, optional, trailing content lambda → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- defaults are meaningful and not hidden behind nullable sentinel behavior; defaults exposed through a `ComponentDefaults` object → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- explicit parameters preferred over component-specific `CompositionLocal` indirection. `CompositionLocal` is appropriate for *tree-scoped* data with sensible defaults (theme tokens like `LocalContentColor`, `LocalTextStyle`); not appropriate for component-specific configuration → [compositionlocal](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/compositionlocal), [api-guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines)
- components are focused and layered instead of multipurpose grab-bags → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- slot APIs (`content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit`) used for flexible composition; receiver scopes (`RowScope`, `ColumnScope`, `BoxScope`) applied where they guide layout → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- `Basic*` naming for unstyled / minimal variants alongside the opinionated public version (e.g. `BasicTextField` ↔ `TextField`) → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- distinct components for visual variants (`ContainedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, `TextButton`) instead of a single component with a `style` enum → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- `@Composable` functions are PascalCase and Unit-returning where they emit UI → [api-guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines)
- UI-emitting composables either emit UI or report via callbacks/state holders, but do not also return handles or computed values → [api-guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines)
- reusable content composables emit a cohesive root node, or explicitly declare a parent-layout scope when they intentionally emit multiple siblings → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- event callbacks are named and positioned as events (`onClick`, `onValueChange`) while trailing lambdas are reserved for composable content slots → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- custom modifiers built with `Modifier.Node` rather than the discouraged `composed { }` factory → [custom modifiers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/custom-modifiers)
- `movableContentOf` / `movableContentWithReceiverOf` used to preserve slot-content lifecycle when content moves between containers → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- reusable APIs prefer `value: T` (immediate read) or `value: () -> T` (deferred read) plus `onValueChange: (T) -> Unit` over `MutableState<T>` parameters → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- isolated components define `@Preview` configurations to prove they render stateless → [tooling](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews)
- reusable animated components expose `animationSpec: AnimationSpec<T> = spring()` (or another appropriate default) when callers may reasonably need timing control, and use meaningful labels on shared/tooling-visible animations → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/customize)

Deduct for:

- shared components missing `modifier` → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- multiple modifier params or modifier applied to the wrong child (anywhere other than the root-most emitted layout) → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- hardcoded strings in UI elements (e.g. `Text("Share with friends")` instead of `stringResource(id = R.string...)`) which break i18n support and create brittle tests → [resources](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/resources)
- hardcoded magic numbers like `.padding(12.dp)` or `.size(24.sp)` or explicit `Color(0xFF...)` instead of routing through `MaterialTheme` tokens or `dimensionResource`. A clean theme is vital for dark mode and accessibility → [theming](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/material3)
- no `@Preview` coverage for extracted UI chunks. If a component is reusable, it should have a preview proving it has no hidden ambient dependencies → [tooling](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews)
- `modifier` with a non-no-op default like `Modifier.padding(8.dp)` (caller's modifier silently loses the padding) → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- parameter ordering that makes APIs awkward or misleading → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- nullable params used only as "use internal default" signals — expose the default explicitly via a `ComponentDefaults` object instead → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- passing raw network models, database entities, or complex domain objects directly into UI components instead of mapping them to stable, UI-specific presentation models (UiState). This leaks backend structure into the presentation tier, encourages giant data models, and often forces the Compose compiler to treat the arguments as unstable. → [architecture](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture)
- `MutableState<T>` or `State<T>` params in reusable APIs when avoidable; the official replacement is `value: T` or `value: () -> T` plus `onValueChange: (T) -> Unit` → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- giant multipurpose components that should be split or wrapped → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- UI-emitting composables that return non-`Unit` values or handles. Report state via callbacks / state holders; keep value-returning composables value-only → [api-guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines)
- reusable content composables that emit multiple sibling roots without an explicit parent scope such as `RowScope` or `ColumnScope`; wrap in a cohesive root layout or make the scope contract explicit → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- pure helpers marked `@Composable` even though they neither read composition data nor emit UI, or `@ReadOnlyComposable` applied to functions that emit UI / launch effects / mutate state → [api-guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/api-guidelines)
- event callbacks placed as the trailing lambda so call sites read like content slots, or callbacks named as past-tense notifications when Compose-style `onXxx` event names would make the contract clearer → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- behavior added as parameters that should be modifiers (`onClick`, `clipToCircle`) → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- style/configuration objects passed to a single component instead of distinct components per variant → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- non-Compose lifecycles attached to composables — for example, an `onClick` callback on a layout component when `Modifier.clickable` would do → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- modifier ordering that quietly changes semantics in shared components (e.g. `Modifier.padding(...).clickable {}` extends the click region into the padding; `Modifier.clickable {}.padding(...)` does not). Flag when the choice looks accidental → [custom modifiers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/custom-modifiers)
- hardcoded `dp`, `sp`, or explicit `Color` constructs in reusable components instead of using `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, `MaterialTheme.typography`, or dimension resources; this destroys dark mode compliance and accessible font scaling → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- `CompositionLocal` used for component-specific configuration (vs. truly tree-scoped data); ViewModels stored in `CompositionLocal`; locals with no sensible default → [compositionlocal](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/compositionlocal)
- custom modifiers built with `Modifier.composed { }` when `Modifier.Node` would do — `composed { }` is officially discouraged for performance → [custom modifiers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/custom-modifiers)
- `Scaffold { innerPadding -> ... }` content that does not apply `innerPadding` to its root child (or consume it via `consumeWindowInsets`) — content draws behind the `TopAppBar` / `BottomAppBar` / system bars → [component API](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-component-api-guidelines.md)
- highly reusable animated composables that hard-code `tween(N)` / specific `spring()` stiffness in the signature when callers would reasonably need control over timing — consider exposing `animationSpec: AnimationSpec<T>` instead → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/customize)
- shared/tooling-visible `animate*AsState` / `updateTransition` call sites missing a meaningful `label` parameter — reduces clarity in Animation Preview and other Android Studio tooling; treat as a light deduction, not a hard failure → [animation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/customize)

Suggested interpretation:

- `9-10`: shared UI APIs are clean, predictable, and reusable
- `7-8`: solid conventions with a few inconsistencies
- `4-6`: repeated API smell in shared components
- `0-3`: shared component APIs are confusing, rigid, or actively error-prone

## Scoring Rules

- One isolated issue should not tank a whole category.
- Repeated issues across several modules should count more than a single bad file.
- Production code matters more than samples, previews, or scratch files.
- Positive patterns should raise confidence and may offset minor issues.
- App teams may intentionally deviate from framework/library guidance. Note the tradeoff before deducting heavily.
- **Every deduction in the report must include a `References:` line citing one or more URLs from the rubric above (or from `references/canonical-sources.md`).** A deduction without a citation should not appear in the report.
