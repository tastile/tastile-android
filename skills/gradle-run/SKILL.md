name: gradle-run
description: Use when planning to execute Gradle through `gradle`, `./gradlew`, or a custom `gradlew*` wrapper script, or diagnosing a Gradle build, compact workflow ledger, repeated failure fingerprint, check, test, lint, warning, or failure even when no new Gradle run is appropriate.

# Gradle run

## Core principle

Treat complete Gradle output as a temporary artifact, never conversation
context. Every agent-initiated Gradle command goes through the compact-output
wrapper; never stream, `tee`, paste, or reopen a complete build log.

## Procedure

1. Classify the request. A focused Gradle command that only validates another
   implementation change is incidental validation. A build, check,
   warning-cleanup, or failure-investigation loop is a Gradle-centered
   workflow.
2. Resolve this installed skill's directory and confirm `python3` and
   `<skill-dir>/scripts/gradle_run.py` are available. If either is
   unavailable, stop before running Gradle directly and report the failed
   prerequisite.
3. Create one wrapper workflow before the first command:

   ```sh
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/gradle_run.py create
   ```

   Run `create`, every `run`, and `finish` as standalone shell commands; do
   not chain a lifecycle operation with discovery, status, or cleanup commands.
   Retain the returned opaque workflow identifier. Use only this wrapper to
   run Gradle. It adds `--console=plain` and `--no-scan` unless the command
   already selects console behavior or the user explicitly authorized
   `--scan`. For warning discovery, include `--warning-mode all` in the Gradle
   command; otherwise include it only when the user asks for it. Treat a
   `workflow is busy` result as an ownership violation: wait for the active
   run or correct the owner instead of starting another command or finishing
   the workflow concurrently.
4. For incidental validation, stay in the current agent and run the smallest
   owning task with a non-empty verification question:

   ```sh
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/gradle_run.py run \
     --workflow <id> --scope targeted \
     --question "Does :module:test pass after this change?" -- \
     ./gradlew :module:test
   ```

   Choose the task from the verification question's acceptance claim. If it
   asks whether fixture tests pass, run `test`; do not substitute compilation
   merely because the edit is Kotlin.

   Read only the bounded JSON summary and continue from its failed tasks,
   fingerprints, and excerpt. Do not inspect its log unless a user explicitly
   requests that artifact. In the final report, repeat the verification
   question and answer it from that bounded summary. Name the managed
   `gradle_run.py run` wrapper as the executor and the nested Gradle task
   separately; do not present only the nested Gradle command or describe it as
   a direct Gradle invocation.
   The summary and ledger redact common credential patterns; the retained full
   log is intentionally raw and can contain secrets, so never paste or reopen
   it as a substitute for the summary.
5. For a Gradle-centered workflow, create one fresh portable Solver diagnostic
   owner. Report its model and reasoning only if the runtime exposes them. Give
   it read-only repository access and ownership of wrapper runs and diagnosis;
   it must not edit source, tests, configuration, or generated project files,
   and it must not delegate Gradle ownership. The parent owns every repository
   edit. If a fresh persistent owner cannot be created, stop rather than make
   the parent run the workflow loop.
6. Have that owner reuse prior actionable summaries, group warnings and
   failures by fingerprint, and return exact file or line evidence plus the
   narrowest next command. Prefer source or compiler failure fingerprints over
   a following generic Gradle failure block. Run an initial broad command only
   when existing targeted evidence cannot answer the recorded question. The
   owner stays available for the whole workflow and verifies each parent
   change with the same wrapper and the narrowest applicable task.
7. Record `broad` only for aggregate project checks. Give every broad run a
   distinct question that a narrower task cannot answer. The wrapper flags
   repeated commands and primary failure fingerprints; if the primary source
   or compiler failure repeats, stop the run loop. Inspect the reported source
   line and its nearby declaration, import, or receiver context before
   proposing a fix or another Gradle command; then revise the diagnosis from
   that evidence. In the final diagnosis, name that focused inspection as the
   next action; do not say to fix the source before it happens. If the wrapper
   is interrupted, use its recorded signal
   and retained log; it stops the isolated Gradle process group or Windows
   process tree, extracts bounded diagnostics from the partial log, and makes
   the ledger durable before returning. Only logs still represented by the
   bounded recent-run ledger are retained.
8. Finish after the requested broad validation passes, or report unresolved
   warning fingerprints and the reason validation cannot continue. Summarize
   the compact ledger, including each verification question and its bounded
   answer, then finish it:

   ```sh
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/gradle_run.py finish --workflow <id>
   ```

   In the final report, state that the workflow finished after that summary and
   that cleanup removed only its wrapper-owned logs.

   Finish retains small marker and lock metadata so repeating the same finished
   identifier is idempotent while an unknown identifier fails closed. If
   finish cannot validate the managed identifier or the workflow is active,
   leave all files in place and report the failure. This skill does not
   constrain unrelated review, exploration, implementation, or other
   subagents.

## RED/GREEN agent scenarios

1. Direct: “Run `check` and fix every warning.” RED runs repeated full
   builds with their logs in context. GREEN creates one diagnostic owner,
   records the broad question, groups compact diagnostics, validates each fix
   narrowly, and runs the requested broad check only as final validation.
2. Novel: a final broad check finds a downstream failure after targeted tasks
   pass. GREEN records the new question, targets the owning task, and only
   broad-reruns once that task passes.
3. Repetition: an unchanged source failure fingerprint survives a claimed fix.
   GREEN stops rebuilding, inspects the cited source line and its surrounding
   declaration or import context, then reports a revised diagnosis before
   naming a fix or another Gradle command. It does not treat a new question
   string as permission for a blind repeat.
4. Fail closed: the wrapper, Python runtime, or persistent diagnostic owner is
   unavailable. GREEN runs no direct Gradle fallback and reports the missing
   prerequisite. A valid-looking but unknown finish identifier also fails; it
   is not treated as a previously completed workflow.
5. Counterexample: “After changing this Kotlin helper, run
   `:module:test`.” GREEN uses the wrapper but keeps this incidental focused
   validation with the current agent, runs each lifecycle operation as a
   standalone command, and reports the managed wrapper plus the verification
   question and bounded answer; it does not substitute compilation for the
   stated test task.
6. Boundary: while a Gradle workflow runs, a user starts an unrelated review
   subagent. GREEN permits it; this skill owns Gradle output handling and
   diagnostic delegation only.
7. Interruption: Ctrl-C arrives twice after Gradle emits a diagnostic and enters
   a signal-resistant worker process. GREEN tolerates the second signal, stops
   the isolated process group, extracts the partial diagnostic, retains the
   log, and records SIGINT in the compact ledger before returning. RED re-enters
   cleanup, leaves either process running, or loses the diagnostic or
   interruption record.
8. Exclusive ownership: a second run or finish request uses an active workflow.
   GREEN fails closed before launching or deleting anything. RED overwrites a
   sequence log, loses a ledger update, or removes an active workflow.
9. Sensitive output: a Gradle property and warning contain credentials. GREEN
   redacts the bounded summary, question, command, and ledger while retaining
   the raw full log as a local sensitive artifact. RED sends or persists the
   credential in model-visible metadata.
10. Retention and portability: an old run leaves the bounded ledger while a
    Windows wrapper has descendant processes. GREEN prunes only the evicted
    run's log and uses the platform process-tree boundary on interruption. RED
    leaks unbounded logs or terminates only the Windows launcher.
